# RTabsPlus

### Tabulate One or Two Variables

A set of tools for running tabs on factor variables that returns the results as 
a dataframe.  Can tab one or two variables against each other, weighted or 
unweighted.  Includes separate versions for quoted and non-quoted input.

Inspired by Stata's `tab` and `svy: tab` functions.
